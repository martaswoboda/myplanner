## Task Scheduler and Prioritization Tool

This project is a task scheduling and prioritization tool designed to help you manage and organize jobs effectively using popular time management techniques such as "Eat the Frog" and the ABC Method.

## Features

- **Add Jobs**: Create new jobs with specific details like title, description, start time, date, urgency, importance, and duration.
- **Edit Jobs**: Modify existing jobs to update their details or reschedule them.
- **Unscheduled Jobs**: View and manage jobs that havenâ€™t been scheduled yet.
- **Job Scheduling**: Automatically schedule jobs based on priority (ABC method), importance, and time availability.
- **Mark Jobs as Completed**: Easily mark jobs as completed from the daily job list.
- **Color Coding for Overdue Tasks**:
  - Green: Completed tasks.
  - Yellow: Tasks nearing their deadline (within 1 hour).
  - Red: Overdue tasks that have not been marked as completed.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adjusts to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.

## Task Prioritization

The Job Scheduler prioritizes tasks using the following methods to ensure optimal efficiency and time management:

1. **"Eat the Frog" Method**  
   The concept of "Eating the Frog" refers to tackling your most difficult or important task first thing in the morning. In this scheduler:
   - Frog tasks are identified as critical, high-priority jobs that should be completed before anything else.
   - These tasks are scheduled at the earliest available time in the morning (starting at 7:00 AM).

2. **Managing by Urgency and Importance (ABC Method)**  
   The scheduler uses the ABC Method to prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance:
   - **A-priority tasks**: High urgency and high importance. These tasks are crucial and must be done as soon as possible. They are scheduled earlier in the day after frog tasks.
   - **B-priority tasks**: Either urgent or important, but not both. These tasks are necessary but can be scheduled after the A-priority tasks.
   - **C-priority tasks**: Neither urgent nor important. These tasks are the least critical and are scheduled later in the day or after other tasks are completed.
